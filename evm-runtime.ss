;; TODO:
;; * better assembler with segments, etc.?
;; * functions that are automatically inlined if called once, or even if tailed-called once.
;; * temporaries that are automatically un-allocated if only used once, immediately (or after shuffling?)

;; We're going to define a hierarchical ABI for contracts, with
;;
;; * Tiny "inline" functions that are expanded inline, operate on stack (what we use below, mostly).
;;   signature is written: instack1 instack2 instack3 ... --> outstack1 outstack2 outstack3 ...
;;   where the leftmost is top of stack (as in evm.md), and elements indicate stack contents
;;
;; * Small "static" functions that use the stack as both data and return stack, local data stack,
;;   that live within a contract invocation.
;;   The signature is also written: instack1 instack2 instack3 ... --> outstack1 outstack2 outstack3 ...
;;   except that one of the inputs is typically a return address ret@C in current code segment,
;;   typically the rightmost argument. The return values if any are left on work stack.
;;   If there are any, last is swapped with the return address just before the JUMP that returns;
;;   often, to avoid lots of swapping in the callee, extra values are left on stack
;;   that the caller must clean after.
;;   + overhead of calling 'subroutineaddr jump [&jumpdest 'retaddr] [8B, 15G]
;;   + overhead of being called and returning: [&jumpdest 'subroutineaddr] ... JUMP [2B, 9G]
;;   + overhead of shuffling arguments around: SWAPn, SWAPn [2B, 6G]
;;   All in all, a small function costs [12B, 30G] for the call and return,
;;   so definitely inline anything below that,
;;   and beyond, depending on how many times the function appears, starting with 2.
;;
;; * Medium "contract-level" functions that live across contract invocation
;;   overhead of calling + returning: copying frames, etc.
;;   These are quite expensive, cost starts at tens of thousands of gas.
;;   They are also limited to what fits in a single contract.
;;   They follow a calling convention with global runtime registers,
;;   then fixed frame address up to contract-dependent address,
;;   then heap.
;;   TODO:
;;   + convention for more than 2 participants.
;;   + convention for content-addressed heap persistence across frames.
;;
;; * Large "cross-contract" that involve DELEGATECALL and possibly CREATE2 to break the code size barrier.
;;   Notably useful for state channels
;;   Expensive in GAS, plus double-copying of arguments from CALLDATA to memory to CALLDATA,
;;   then of results to memory with RETURNDATACOPY.
;;   But OK if only used in case of disputes, where the loser covers the fees.
;;
;; * Huge "virtualized" functions that use a VM on top of the EVM with challenge for execution verification.
;;   OK for huge computations, in the style of TrueBit, Fluence.
;;
;; This file includes some tiny blocks, supports defining small functions,
;; and provides runtime infrastructure to define medium functions.

;; As for the calling convention of the contract from the outside world,
;; each contract call contains as its bytes argument an input buffer,
;; which will be read and interpreted by the contract code as follows:
;;   1. A call frame, with all the data required to restart computation,
;;      prepended by a 2-byte frame length.
;;      The frame starts with the pc and the timer-start,
;;      then contains the values of frame-specific variables.
;;      (So far, all values are stored as a fixed number of bytes
;;      depending on their type, with no padding.)
;;      If the frame matches the saved state, the program resumes, otherwise it aborts.
;;   2. *In the future*, to handle arbitrary recursive DAGs of data, the calling
;;      participant can reveal an arbitrary subgraph of a merkleized DAG in working memory,
;;      in a TBD format that will be validated by the program (that will otherwise abort).
;;   3. The program will continue, and the frame then contains any variable published
;;      in the current code block, in order of publication (with same type-dependent encoding),
;;      from which the program will read the published data.
;;   4. At the end of the code block, the program either terminates or reaches a new state,
;;      stored in a fixed-address scratch area after the frame variables and locals.
;;   5. If the program reached a new state, it expects either a 0 or a 1 as input,
;;      to specify whether the same participant continues with the next code block or stops.
;;   6. If the program continues, it will overwrite the fixed address frame area
;;       with data from the fixed address scratch area, then recursing to step 3.
;;   7. If the program stops, then the program saves the digest of the frame to persistent state,
;;      logs all the data after frame restoration, and commits the transaction.
;;
;; Note: which of 0 or 1 to mean continue vs stop depends on whether we want to optimize
;; for the one-block case (0 is stop) or the multiple-block case (0 is continue),
;; something we could even in the future decide on a contract-per-contract basis.

;; - `end` is an identifier which will be defined as the next available address after these

;; Finally, any remaining arguments specify the actual variables. They have the form

;;
;; The macro generates the following definitions:
;;
;; - A getter, with the same name `param`.
;; - A setter, named `param-set!`.
;; - A numeric address, named `param@`.
;; - A length, named `param-length`.
;; - A POO object, grouping all of the above into a value that
;;   can be passed around as a unit. This is named `param-var`.
;;
;; The getter and setter will only be useful if the length is between 0 and 32

;; 2. Make the interaction unusable (assuming it uses our ABI) by putting 0 in its state digest

;;
;; - This knows about our assets abstraction, and will transfer *all* assets to the recipient,
;;   not just the native token but also e.g. ERC20s.
;; - The larger contract remains usable, only the current interaction is destroyed.
;; - If the contract doesn't use our ABI, then step 2 is useless and the interaction might still
;;   be "usable".
;; - A real SELFDESTRUCT costs much less gas and always succeeds to send with no opportunity
;;   for the recipient to either log data or deny the request.
