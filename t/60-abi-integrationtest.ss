      ;;      bad transactions, especially when the gas is below the intrinsic gas.
      ;;   2. Then the sender account becomes unusable, never ever again capable of sending any
      ;;      transaction, its funds forever locked away (hopefully Mantis will at least do the
      ;;      right thing if another node submits a block with rival transactions that
      ;;      update the nonce, etc. --- but does it?).

      ;;      the client anything went wrong, so the client can hang forever waiting for confirmation.
      ;;   4. Even if the client reacts and tries to send an alternative, rival transaction with the
      ;;      same nonce, the latter will end up rejected by Mantis for conflicting with a transaction
      ;;      that will never be committed.
