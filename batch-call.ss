;;; EVM Contract for batch calls.
;;
;;  This contract generalizes the batch-send contract, allowing for arbitrary contract calls.
;;
;;  Instead of sending a series of N transactions, have a single transaction that does it all.
;;  The advantage is that you have only one transaction to nurse to completion,
;;  which is a much less complex thing to do, with fewer and simpler failure scenarios to handle.
;;  This is especially important if your transaction posting code needs to deal with
;;  FOMO3D-style block-buying attacks, or other rapid gas price increase events.
;;
;;  The input data format does not use the Solidity ABI; we use a simpler and cheaper style:
;;  Just a raw vector of 32-byte records each comprised of a 20-byte address and a 12-byte value,
;;  then a 2-byte message length, then as many specified bytes, to pass to the contract being called.
;;  (use length 0 for a simple send).
;;
;;  No 4-byte header to identify a "function" to call; there's only one "function".
;;  No 32-byte vector count as first implicit argument; the size is taken from CALLDATASIZE.
;;  We copy the message to memory so we can send it to the contract, to a buffer starting at offset 0.
;;
;;  We do NOT check a contract owner (maybe we should?). Be careful not to leave money in the contract,
;;  and be careful not to depend on the contract always having the same owner
;;  (or else, add an owner check).
;;
;;  If any single call in the batch fails (because it REVERTs, or lacks funds or gas, etc.),
;;  revert the entire transaction (which cancels all the transfers that previously succeeded,
;;  but still includes the transaction as "failed" on the blockchain, and transfers the gas
;;  from the transaction sender to the miners).

;; Create the runtime code for a batch call contract associated to given owner
;; An owner is needed because the calls made by this contract will themselves have
;; the contract's address as the CALLER (there's no way to make the top-level tx itself
;; a DELEGATECALL, it's always an implicit CALL), therefore to be able to usefully call an ERC20
;; without anyone being able to spend the tokens, we can have only one owner
;; to a given batch-call contract.
