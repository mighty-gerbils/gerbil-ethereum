;;;; Presigned transactions, for some contracts to have the same address on all EVM blockchains
;;
;; An author may generate a random address for a creator account, and
;; have it sign transactions to create a contract or a series of contracts,
;; starting with nonce 0, for all possible values of the gasPrice
;; on a logarithmic scale with step sqrt(2),
;; so that whatever the present or future level of the gasPrice, you can always
;; fund the creator account and have it post the contract-creating transaction
;; with at most 42% of lossage in gas costs.
;; Then, one should delete that address.
;;
;; Do you have to trust the author to have deleted the creator address?
;; No, you don't: you can and must verify for each blockchain where you intend
;; to rely on it that the contract either exists with the correct content, or
;; that creator address was never used on the blockchain, in which case you
;; should use the presigned transactions to create the contract yourself at
;; the expected address, and wait for confirmation before you rely on it.
;; If those conditions aren't satisfied, then either:
;; (1) the blockchain has a starting nonce other than 0,
;; (2) someone broke the encryption (then all blockchains are broken), or
;; (3) the author lied to you.
;; The most the author can steal by lying is the gas to create the contract
;; (minus the tx fee), and then again only if they are sophisticated enough
;; to race your transactions between the one that funds the creator address
;; and the one that creates the contract, and then still, only on a single
;; blockchain, at which point everyone knows they are a cheat and won't
;; believe them ever on any blockchain or for anything else.
;; That would be a piss poor reward for losing their reputation forever.
;; But, again, please don't take any author's word: verify there was no abuse
;; before you rely on the address of a contract with presigned transactions.
